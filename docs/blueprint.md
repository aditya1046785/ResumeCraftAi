## Style Guidelines:

- The supportive, confidence-building tone suggests a soothing and trustworthy primary color: Light desaturated blue (#94B0DA). In hex code it is equivalent to rgb(148, 176, 218).
- Background color: A very light blue to complement the primary, and reinforce trust through soft cool hues (#F0F4F8). In hex code it is equivalent to rgb(240, 244, 248).
- Accent color: A muted purple, an analogous hue that stands out gently but feels collaborative with the primary (#B19CD9). In hex code it is equivalent to rgb(177, 156, 217).
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headlines and body, ensuring a modern and readable experience. 'Inter' will give the application a neutral, objective look suitable to a professional app.
- Use clean, professional icons to represent resume sections and actions. Use icons from a consistent set, with a line thickness that matches the weight of the fonts being used. Use iconography sparingly to avoid a cluttered look.
- Maintain a clean and structured layout to highlight information hierarchy. Utilize white space effectively to enhance readability and reduce visual clutter. Focus on single-column layouts for optimal ATS compatibility.
- Use subtle, non-distracting transitions and animations to enhance the user experience. For example, a subtle fade-in for AI suggestions.
